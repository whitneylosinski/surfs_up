# Surf's Up!

## Purpose
This project is to analyze weather data in Oahu, Hawaii from an SQLite database to try and get investors to invest in a surf board and ice cream shop called Surf's Up!.  The analysis will be used to show investors weather trends in Oahu so they can see how the weather will effect the success of the surfing and ice cream shop.  Specifically the investors want to see the following data:

 - Precipitation data from Oahu weather stations for one year.
 - Number of stations collecting data.
 - Most active stations.
 - Low, High and Average temperatures for the most active station.
 - Histogram of temperature observations for the most active station.
 - Temperature data for June in Oahu.
 - Temperature data for December in Oahu.
 
## Resources
Data: hawaii.sqlite<br/>
Software: Python 3.8, Jupyter Notebook (anaconda3), VS Code, Flask

## Results
Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary
The results of the analysis show that Surf's Up! surf and ice cream shop could be a sustainable year-round business in Oahu in regards to temperature.  The data shows that Oahu in June has an average temperature of 75°F with a high of 85°F and a low of 64°F.  The temperature in December is slightly cooler with an average of 71°F, a high of 83°F and a low of 56°F.  Although the low for December is quite a bit colder than June, the average is only 4° cooler and still within ideal surfing and ice cream eating temperatures.

To look a bit deeper into the sustainability of the shop year-round, it would also be smart to compare the precipitation in June versus that in December.  Since people don't typically surf or eat ice cream as much if it's raining, precipitation could play an important part in the success of the shop as well.  The two additional queries for the low, high and average precipitation in June and the low, high and average precipitation in December are shown below.
