# Surfs Up

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze weather data in Oahu, Hawaii from an SQLite database to try and get investors to invest in a surf board and ice cream shop.  The analysis will be used to show investors weather trends in Oahu so they can see how the weather will effect the success of the surfing and ice cream shop.  Specifically the investors want to see the following data:

 - Precipitation data from Oahu weather stations for one year.
 - Number of stations collecting data.
 - Most active stations.
 - Low, High and Average temperatures for the most active station.
 - Histogram of temperature observations for the most active station.
 - Temperature data for June in Oahu.
 - Temperature data for December in Oahu.
